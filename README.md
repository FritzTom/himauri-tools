# Himauri Tool(s)

Translation Tool for the Himauri game engine (sometimes refered to as SH System)

Made by [@iheq](https://github.com/iheq) in collaboration with [@Fritz_Tom](https://github.com/FritzTom/)

# Setup

Download the [fushigi](https://github.com/CoffeeFlux/Fushigi-Tools) folder from @CoffeeFlux 's repo

Put the folder in the same folder as the scripts.

Create a folder called "temp".

# Usage
The main purpose of this tool is to repack text scripts. If you want to repack other assets such as images use [this](https://github.com/iHeq/him5-repacker).

The program will prompt you with the following options.

> "Extract" | Do you want to extract all script files from the archive? (Replaces all files in temp)

> "Edit" | Do you want to edit (replace/export) a specific script file in the archive?

> "Path to the binary file" | Export/Edit a specific script file (binary).

> "Export" | Export the selected binary file -> can be found in the script's directory under the name "strings". (this is the file you should edit when translating)

> "Import" | Import the selected binary file -> will insert the "strings" file to the selected binary.

> "Pack" | Repack all binaries in the "temp" directory to a new HXP archive.

The options you have are "YES" and "NO".

For "YES" type anything and press enter (e.g. "y" and then enter).

For "NO" leave blank and just press enter.
